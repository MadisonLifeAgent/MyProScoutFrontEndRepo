Project Summary:

myProScout is a player profiles management application.

myProScout solves two problems:
- The need for paper notes
- Quicker collaboration amongst scouts

For the first problem's solution, a scout can use myProScout to create, view, edit, or delete player profiles. Scouts can create scouting reports and keep track of stats and take notes during a scouting event.

This leads into the second problem's solution, where scouting reports can be saved as they are still being written, allowing other scouts to view the latest saved version of a report. Scouting reports can be easily accessed, so review and analysis can be conducted sooner helping an organization save time.

myProScout was built using:
- ASP.NET Core Web API Backend
- MS SQL Server
- React frontend
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
